# shiny-data-witch
A small shiny app to reformat data from wide to long and vice versa. 
I programmed it for an assignment in the Programming for Psychological Science course at the University of Amsterdam.

# Quickstart
The app allows you to utilize tidyverse functionality to convert data in a csv file from long to wide and vice versa using a graphical interface.

You can run the app from your browser: 
https://lukekorthals.shinyapps.io/shiny-data-witch/

Or you can run the app in R:

    runGitHub( "shiny-data-witch", "lukekorthals")

# Screenshot
This is how the app looks like.
